# EZGrab
Our application is a delivery system that allows people to make purchases (food,household items, etc.), without leaving the comfort of their homes and getting it delivered in a short amount of time with the help of other users. Our application takes the concept of hitchhiking as an inspiration where in our use case, our users will be able to ‘hitchhike’ or make purchases per se while other users are on route to or passing by the delivery point.
